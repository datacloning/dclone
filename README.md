# dclone: Data Cloning and MCMC Tools for Maximum Likelihood Methods

[![CRAN version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/dclone)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dclone)
[![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/dclone)](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dclone)
[![Linux build status](https://travis-ci.org/datacloning/dclone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datacloning/dclone)

Low level functions for implementing
maximum likelihood estimating procedures for
complex models using data cloning and Bayesian
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
as described in Solymos 2010 ([R Journal 2(2):29--37](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Solymos.pdf)).
Sequential and parallel MCMC support
for JAGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, and Stan.
